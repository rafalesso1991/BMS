      <h1>BMS - Book Managment System</h1>
      <p>This is an application that allows users to purchase and manage their books selected from a list of titles stored in a database called "book store".</p>
      <p>Once registered, users will be able to filter their owned books by name, author, genre, and year of publication.</p>
      <p>There is also a section where you can see the titles of the books available to add to your collection with reviews from users who own books with those titles.</p>
      <p>This page is a web development project for the final test of the Blas Pascal University diploma for the year 2023 - 2024. I hope you like it.</p>
